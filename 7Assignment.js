//Assignment Examples
    //The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable
let x = 10;
    //The += assignment operator assigns adds a value to a variable
let x = 10;
x += 5;
    //The -= assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable
let x = 10;
x -= 5;
    //The *= assignment operator multiplies a variable
let x = 10;
x *= 5;
    //The /= assignment operator divides a variable
let x = 10;
x /= 5;
    //The %= assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable
let x = 10;
x %= 5;
